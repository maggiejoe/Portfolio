# Maggie Joseph's Professional Portfolio


## Description

This project was to test our knowledge of the last two modules focusing on HTML and Advanced CSS. The objective was to create a professional portfolio where we can share our work created throughout the course to potential employers in an easy and consice manner. 


## Challenges

The most challenging part of this project was adding flexboxes in the work section. To say the least, this was a real brain teaser and had me spinning for days. Luckily, through the help of BCS pointing me in the right direction to understand flexbox better I was able to set this section up similar to the mock-up provided.

Going forward I have a lot more resources to reference (in addition to this project) when playing around with flexbox to help broaden my understanding.
